# Local Setup

This file aims to walk through the steps of getting this project running locally. If you have any trouble, please open an issue or join the Discord for help.

## Understanding the guide

This guide assumes you are using a terminal to run commands.

- If you are using VSCode, you can use the built-in terminal. Press `Ctrl + Backtick` to open the terminal.
- If you are using Windows, you can use the built-in Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal.
- If you are using macOS or Linux, you can use the built-in Terminal app.

When you see a command like this, this is instructing you to run the command in your terminal:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

## Required installs

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - Version control. Allows you to run `git` commands in your terminal.
- [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases) - Enables you to install and swap between different versions of Node.js. If you are not on Windows, use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation) - Package manager of choice for the project.
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)- Code Editor. Use whatever you prefer, but I recommend VSCode.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) - Enables you to quickly spin up a local Postgres database.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) - Enables you to quickly spin up a local Postgres database.

#### NVM for Windows

Once you have installed NVM, activate NodeJS v22.15.0 (or any other version) by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
nvm install 22.15.0
nvm use 22.15.0
```

#### Install PNPM

This project uses PNPM as the package manager. You can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

## First-time Setup

### Clone the repository

In your terminal, run the following commands to clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/toolkits-gg/toolkitsgg-web.git
cd toolkitsgg-web
```

### Install the dependencies

Run the following command to install the dependencies for the project:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Set up the `.env` file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Local database setup

#### Update the .env file

Ensure the `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL` in your `.env` match the default value in `.env.example`.

### Start the Docker container

```bash
pnpm db-start
```

#### Generate Prisma Typescript types

```bash
pnpm prisma-push
```

Once complete, the updated Typescript types will be generated automatically. In the event you are still getting Typescript errors, you can restart the Typescript server in VSCode by opening the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS) and typing `TypeScript: Restart TS Server`.

#### Run the seed script

To make it easier to develop, you can seed the database with some initial data. Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm db-seed
```

This will populate your database via the [seed script](../src/lib/prisma/seed.ts).

### Create a free Resend account (optional)

Resend is used for sending emails. For local development, you only need this if you intend to test sending emails. Creating and previewing emails **DOES NOT** require a Resend account and can be done locally.

1. Go to [Resend](https://resend.com/) and create a free account.
2. Create a new API key and copy it to your `.env` file as `RESEND_KEY`.

## Managing the local environment

### Start the development server

Run the following command in your terminal to start the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### Build the project

To build the project for production, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

### Run the production build

To run the production build, first build the project and then run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run start
```

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the project running.

### Lint the project

Linting is important to ensure code quality. To lint the project, run:

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

If you want to lint and fix any issues automatically, you can run:

```bash
pnpm run lint-fix
```

### Type-check the project

To ensure the build will complete, run the TypeScript type checker:

```bash
pnpm run type-check
```

### Run tests

**TODO**: surely....

### Interacting with the database

Prisma Studio is a locally hosted application that allows you to view and interact with your database.

In a separate terminal window, run the following command to start Prisma Studio:

```bash
pnpm prisma-studio
```

This will open Prisma Studio in your web browser at `http://localhost:5555`, where you can view and manage your database.

### Changes to the database schema

If you make changes to the database schema, you will need to run the following commands to update your database:

```bash
pnpm prisma-push
```

Once complete, the updated Typescript types will be generated automatically. In the event you are still getting Typescript errors, you can restart the Typescript server in VSCode by opening the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS) and typing `TypeScript: Restart TS Server`.

### Seed the database

To make it easier to develop, you can seed the database with some initial data. Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm db-seed
```

This will populate your database via the [seed script](../src/lib/prisma/seed.ts)

## Managing Docker Containers

Run the following commands from the project directory:

- `docker-compose up` to start the docker containers and build the dist files
- `docker-compose up -d` to start the containers and build the dist files in detached mode
- `docker-compose stop` to stop detached mode
- `docker-compose down` to stop the container and purge its containers and networks
- `ctrl+c` to stop
